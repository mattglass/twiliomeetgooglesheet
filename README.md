twiliomeetgooglesheet
=====================

I wrote this script for a Client to use in the Transportation industry. It connects Google Spreadsheets with the Twilio API. The script automagically generates a custom SMS message based on column data and sends a tailored SMS message to the user based on their inputs. App uses a block of Twilio numbers for faster processing.
